Last updated: April 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies regarding privacy and data use in relation to the
Marine Screen application.

We want to make it clear: We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users.

No Collection of Personal Data
------------------------------
Marine Screen does not collect any personally identifiable information (such as name, email address,
phone number, or location), usage data, or any other information that could be used to identify you.

We do not use tracking technologies, cookies, or analytics tools within the application.
Your use of the app is entirely private and anonymous.

Children’s Privacy
------------------
Our Service does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data to be removed.

Third-Party Services
--------------------
Marine Screen does not integrate with or share data with any third-party services that would result
in the collection or transmission of your personal data.

If you follow external links from the application (e.g., to a website or support page),
please review their privacy policies separately, as they are outside our control.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
------------------------------
Although we don’t collect any personal data, we may occasionally update this policy to reflect
changes in our practices or legal requirements.
Updates will be posted here with a revised “Last updated” date.
